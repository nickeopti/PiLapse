## Installing Raspbian

> This assumes that you have internet connectivity on your Raspberry Pi

Download [NOOBS Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/) by clicking `Download ZIP`, unzip it onto a freshly formatted SD card [as described here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/software-guide/quickstart/), eject the SD card and insert it into your Raspberry Pi.

Connect Internet, Keyboard (optionally mouse) and display to the Pi, and power it up.

After a while, a dialog appears. Select Raspbian (recommended) from the list, either by clicking the mouse or by navigating with the arrow keys on the keyboard. Tick it with `Enter` and press `i` (for install). Confirm by pressing `Alt + Y`, and wait, wait, wait.
